Overview
--------

Welcome to 20.180, MIT Biological Engineering's programming course! For many of you this will be the first time learning to program computers; others may already be programming gurus. Regardless of your background, upon completing 20.180 you'll have learned how to solve complex biological engineering problems using computational approaches. You'll also discover the rudiments of how to program DNA, the genetic material that runs inside all living organisms. Along the way, you'll be exposed to powerful ideas that underlie all of modern engineering. We hope that you have a great experience with the course!

Assignments and Exams
---------------------

We expect that all assignments will be turned in by 5pm on the day they are due. You may discuss assignments with your classmates but we expect that you will submit your own work. Late assignments will be assigned a grade of zero (your lowest assignment grade will be dropped from your final grade). A family crisis or severe illness requiring attention from the infirmary and prohibiting you from all your coursework are acceptable reasons for missing an exam; every effort will be made to accommodate you in these exceptional circumstances.
